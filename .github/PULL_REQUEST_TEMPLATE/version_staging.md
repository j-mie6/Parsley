# Parsley `x.y.0` Staging PR
This is the PR encompassing all changes for version `x.y.0`. As this is substantial new functionality, it will be previewed incrementally starting with `x.y.0-M1`. When the API is completed and seems reasonable, `x.y.0-RC1` will be released to allow for testing of the release, full documentation, and ironing out of bugs. When the release is stable enough, it will be merged into `master` and `x.y.0` will be officially released.

As each milestone release may choose to make binary incompatible changes, any necessary migration requires to get from one milestone to the next will be tracked here.

<!-- Remove this when the first milestone is ready: if this is a MAJOR release then provide migration from latest-release, and "No changes required" for MINOR releases. -->
