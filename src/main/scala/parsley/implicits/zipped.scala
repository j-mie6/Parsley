// TODO: Scaladoc bug where the `f` and `z` macros aren't expanding into the methods, so it's duplicated. Works on Scala 3 though
/** This module provides alternatives to the `f.lift(x, y)` syntax, `(x, y).zipped(f)`, which works better with type inference.
  *
  * Also enables a parameterless `zipped` method, to pair an arbitrary number of parsers such that `(p, q).zipped = p.zip(q)`.
  *
  * ''Thanks to Andrei Gramescu and George Stacey for ensuring that these combinators even exist in the first place''.
  *
  * @example {{{
  * scala> import parsley.character.char
  * scala> import parsley.implicits.zipped.{Zipped2, Zipped3}
  * scala> case class Add(x: Int, y: Int)
  * scala> val p = (char('a') #> 4, char('b') #> 5).zipped(Add)
  * scala> p.parse("ab")
  * val res0 = Success(Add(4, 5))
  * scala> val q = (char('a') #> 3, char('b') #> 2, char('c') #> 5).zipped((x, y, z) => x * y + z)
  * scala> q.parse("abc")
  * val res1 = Success(11)
  * scala> q.parse("ab")
  * val res2 = Failure(..)
  * }}}
  *
  * @note these methods are '''not''' lazy like the `lift` syntax or `liftN` functions! Use the [[parsley.Parsley.LazyParsley.unary_~ prefix `~`]] combinator
  *       to make arguments lazy where necessary.
  * @since 3.0.0
  *
  * @define constructor This constructor should not be called manually, it is designed to be used via Scala's implicit resolution.
  * @define classdesc This class enables the `zipped` syntax on tuples of
  * @define paramdesc parsers whose results should be zipped together.
  *
  * @define fdesc the function to apply across the results of all the parsers.
  * @define freturn a parser that seqeunces each of these parsers and combines their results with the function `f`.
  * @define fbody
  *     This combinator executes each of these parsers and combines their results with a given function.
  *
  *     Each of these parsers is executed in turn, each yielding a result. So long as every parser
  *     succeeded, the whole combinator succeeds and each of the results is fed into the function `f`.
  *     The result of applying `f` to the results is returned by the combinator. If any of these parsers
  *     fail, the whole combinator fails.
  *
  * @define zreturn a parser that seqeunces each of these parsers and pairs them all together.
  * @define zbody
  *     This combinator executes each of these parsers and pairs all their results together.
  *
  *     Each of these parsers is executed in turn, each yielding a result. So long as every parser
  *     succeeded, the whole combinator succeeds.
  *     The pair formed from all of the results is returned by the parser. If any of these parsers
