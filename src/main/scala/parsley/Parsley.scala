/**
  * This is the class that encapsulates the act of parsing and running an object of this class with `parse` will
  * parse the string given as input to `parse`.
  *
  * @note In order to construct an object of this class you must use the combinators; the class itself is opaque.
  *
  * @author Jamie Willis
  * @version 4.0.0
  *
  * @groupprio run 0
  * @groupname run Running Parsers
  * @groupdesc run These methods allow for a parser to be executed.
  *
  * @groupprio map 20
  * @groupname map Result Changing Combinators
  * @groupdesc map
  *     These combinators change the result of the parser they are called on into a value
  *     of a different type. This new result value may or may not be derived from the previous
  *     result.
  *
  * @groupprio alt 25
  * @groupname alt Branching Combinators
  * @groupdesc alt
  *     These combinators allow for parsing one alternative or another. All of these combinators
  *     are ''left-biased'', which means that the left-hand side of the combinator is tried first:
  *     the right-hand side of the combinator will only be tried when the left-hand one failed
  *     (and did not consume input in the process).
  *
  * @groupprio seq 25
  * @groupname seq Sequencing Combinators
  * @groupdesc seq
  *     These combinators all combine two parsers in sequence. The receiver of the combinator
  *     will be executed first, then the argument second. The results of both parsers are combined
  *     in some way (depending on the individual combinator). If one of the parsers fails, the
  *     combinator as a whole fails.
  *
  * @groupprio filter 50
  * @groupname filter Filtering Combinators
  * @groupdesc filter
  *     These combinators perform filtering on the results of a parser. This means that, given
  *     the result of a parser, they will perform some function on that result, and the success
  *     of that function effects whether or not the parser fails.
  *
  * @groupprio fold 50
  * @groupname fold Folding Combinators
  * @groupdesc fold
  *     These combinators repeatedly execute a parser (at least zero or one times depending on
  *     the specific combinator) until it fails. The results of the successes are then combined
  *     together using a folding function. An initial value for the accumulation may be given
  *     (for the `fold`s), or the first successful result is the initial accumulator (for the
  *     `reduce`s). These are implemented efficiently and do not need to construct any intermediate
  *     list with which to store the results.
  *
  * @groupprio monad 75
  * @groupname monad Expensive Sequencing Combinators
  * @groupdesc monad
  *     These combinators can sequence two parsers, where the first parser's result influences
  *     the structure of the second one. This may be because the second parser is generated
  *     from the result of the first, or that the first parser ''returns'' the second parser.
  *     Either way, the second parser cannot be known until runtime, when the first parser
  *     has been executed: this means that Parsley is forced to compile the second parser during
  *     parse-time, which is '''very''' expensive to do repeatedly. These combinators are only
  *     needed in exceptional circumstances, and should be avoided otherwise.
  *
  * @groupprio special 100
  * @groupname special Special Methods
  * @groupdesc special These are methods that should be rarely needed.
  *
  * @define attemptreason
  *     The reason for this behaviour is that it prevents space leaks and improves error messages. If this behaviour
  *     is not desired, use `attempt(this)` to rollback any input consumed on failure.
  *
  * @define or
  *     parses `q` if this parser fails '''without''' consuming input.
  *
  *     If this parser is successful, then this combinator is successful and no further action is taken. Otherwise, if this parser
  *     fails '''without''' consuming input, then `q` is parsed instead. If this parser fails having consumed
  *     input, this combinator fails.
  *
  * @define orconst
  *     returns `x` if this parser fails '''without''' consuming input.
  *
  *     If this parser is successful, then this combinator is successful and no further action is taken. Otherwise, if this parser
  *     fails '''without''' consuming input, then `x` is unconditionally returned. If this parser fails having consumed
  *     input, this combinator fails. Functionally the same as `this <|> pure(x)`.
  *
  * @define bind
  *     first performs this parser, then uses its result to generate and execute a new parser.
  *
  *     First, this combinator runs this parser. If it succeeded, the result `x` is given to the function `f`
  *     to produce a new parser `f(x)`. This new parser is then executed and its result returned. If either
  *     of this parser or the new parser fails, then the entire combinator fails.
  *
  *     This is a very powerful combinator (Turing-powerful, in fact): it is only necessary (and not ''all''
  *     the time) to use this for context-sensitive parsing. The idea is that it can make any form of
  *     decision based on the result of a parser, allowing it to perform a different parser for each
  *     possible output of another without exhaustively enumerating them all.

/** This object contains the core "function-style" combinators: all parsers will likely require something from within!
  *
  * In particular, it contains combinators for: controlling how input is consumed; injecting values into
  * the parser, or failing; extracting position information from the parser; conditional execution of
  * parsers; and more.
  *
  * @groupprio cond 25
  * @groupname cond Conditional Combinators
  * @groupdesc cond
  *     These combinators will decide which branch to take next based on the result of another parser.
  *     This differs from combinators like `<|>` which make decisions based on the success/failure of
  *     a parser: here the result of a ''successful'' parse will direct which option is done. These
  *     are sometimes known as "selective" combinators.
  *
  * @groupprio prim 0
  * @groupname prim Primitive Combinators
  * @groupdesc prim
  *     These combinators are specific to parser combinators. In one way or another, they influence how a
  *     parser consumes input, or under what conditions a parser does or does not fail. These are really
  *     important for most practical parsing considerations, although `lookAhead` is much less well used.
  *
  * @groupprio basic 5
  * @groupname basic Consumptionless Parsers
  * @groupdesc basic
  *     These combinators and parsers do not consume input: they are the most primitive ways of producing
  *     successes and failures with the minimal possible effect on the parse. They are, however, reasonably
  *     useful; in particular, `pure` and `unit` can be put to good use in injecting results into a parser
  *     without needing to consume anything, or mapping another parser.
  *
  * @groupprio pos 10
  * @groupname pos Position-Tracking Parsers
  * @groupdesc pos
  *     These parsers provide a way to extract position information during a parse. This can be important
  *     for when the final result of the parser needs to encode position information for later consumption:
  *     this is particularly useful for abstract syntax trees.
  *
  * @groupprio monad 100
  * @groupname monad Expensive Sequencing Combinators
  * @groupdesc monad
  *     These combinators can sequence two parsers, where the first parser's result influences
  *     the structure of the second one. This may be because the second parser is generated
  *     from the result of the first, or that the first parser ''returns'' the second parser.
  *     Either way, the second parser cannot be known until runtime, when the first parser
  *     has been executed: this means that Parsley is forced to compile the second parser during
  *     parse-time, which is '''very''' expensive to do repeatedly. These combinators are only
  *     needed in exceptional circumstances, and should be avoided otherwise.
