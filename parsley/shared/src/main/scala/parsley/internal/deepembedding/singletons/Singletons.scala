/** Singletons are special instances of combinators which do not take other parsers as arguments.
  * As such, they cannot have recursive parsers inside them and do not need to distinguish between
  * strict and lazy combinator trees. They are also special in that they all generate single
  * instructions.
  *
  * The `Singleton` class captures these constraints to generalise all three of the frontend and
  * backend methods.
  *
  * @note due to the fact these appear in the frontend, they must not be mutable, for the same
  *       reasons as detailed in `LazyParsley`
