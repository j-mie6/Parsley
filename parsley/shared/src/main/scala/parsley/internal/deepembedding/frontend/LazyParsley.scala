    // of the methods below to be trampolined, which evaluates them in a loop, trading
    // stack-space for heap-space. Each method is parameterised, however, by an ''abstract''
    // `Cont`, because in the event that a parser doesn't stack overflow under normal
    // execution, it is preferable to evaluate it under the much lighter-weight Identity
    // Monad, or `Id`. The choice of monad is delegated to `computeInstrs`.
