// TODO: Scaladoc bug where the macros aren't expanding into the methods, so it's duplicated. Works on Scala 3 though
/** This module provides the "`lift` syntax", which enables a `lift` combinator on functions
  * of arities up to 22, applying the function across the results of several parsers.
  *
  * @example {{{
  * scala> import parsley.character.char
  * scala> import parsley.implicits.lift.{Lift2, Lift3}
  * scala> case class Add(x: Int, y: Int)
  * scala> val p = Add.lift(char('a') #> 4, char('b') #> 5)
  * scala> p.parse("ab")
  * val res0 = Success(Add(4, 5))
  * scala> val f = (x: Int, y: Int, z: Int) => x * y + z
  * scala> val q = f.lift(char('a') #> 3, char('b') #> 2, char('c') #> 5)
  * scala> q.parse("abc")
  * val res1 = Success(11)
  * scala> q.parse("ab")
  * val res2 = Failure(..)
  * }}}
  *
  * @since 3.0.0
  * @note a limitation of this syntax is that it requires the function's type to be fully known.
  *       For a version of this syntax that behaves better with type inference, see [[zipped `zipped`]].
  *
  * @define constructor This constructor should not be called manually, it is designed to be used via Scala's implicit resolution.
  * @define classdesc This class enables the `lift` syntax on functions of arity
  * @define paramdesc the function to apply to the parsers.
  *
  * @define body
  *     This combinator executes each of its argument parsers in turn and applies this function to their results.
  *
  *     Each of the given parsers is executed in sequence, each yielding a result. So long as
  *     every parser succeeded, the whole combinator succeeds and each of the results is fed into
  *     this function. The result of this application is returned by the combinator. If any
  *     of the given parsers fails then the whole combinator fails.
  * @define return a parser that applies this function to the results of all the given parsers.
